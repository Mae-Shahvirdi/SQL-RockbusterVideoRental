# SQL- ROCKBUSTER STEALTH LLC

## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company with stores around the world. Instacart, an established online grocery platform, seeks to refine its marketing efforts.

## Context
Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. They believe that a one-size-fits-all approach isn't optimal. My analysis aims to segment customers effectively and propose targeted strategies to enhance product sales.

## Key questions and objectives
Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions? 

## Data source
The project utilizes open-source datasets sourced from Instacart, supplemented by custom-created customer datasets. These assets are essential for tackling the specified business query.

## Stakeholders
The findings obtained from this analysis will benefit:

The Marketing Vice President
The Senior Vice President of Sales
Instacart's clientele

The objective is to synchronize marketing tactics with customer preferences and unveil potential areas of growth within Instacart's product range.
